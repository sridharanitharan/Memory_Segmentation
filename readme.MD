## Data Segment

- **global_init_variable**: Initialized to 6, address at 0x563131122010.
- **variable_1**: Static variable initialized to 5, address at 0x563131122014.

## BSS Segment

- **global_variable**: Uninitialized global variable, address at 0x56313112201c.
- **variable_2**: Uninitialized static variable, address at 0x563131122020.

## Heap Segment

- **heap_variable**: Dynamically allocated using `malloc(4)`, address at 0x5631314f32a0. Address varies with each program run due to dynamic memory allocation.

## Stack Segment

- **stack_variable in main()**: Local variable within `main()`, address at 0x7ffd2c088bcc. Located lower compared to heap and data segment addresses due to stack's LIFO structure.

## Function Call and Stack Frame

- **stack_frame() Function Call**: Calls `stack_frame()`, declaring its own `stack_variable` locally with an address at 0x7ffd2c088ba4. This address is lower than `stack_variable` in `main()`, reflecting stack's LIFO order.

# Stack Frame Overview

A stack frame is a critical structure in the execution of functions in C programming. It manages local variables, function parameters, return addresses, and saved registers during function execution. Understanding stack frames is essential for efficient memory management and debugging.

## Components of a Stack Frame

1. **Saved Registers**:
   - Registers that must be preserved across function calls to maintain their values. Examples include `%ebp`, `%ebx`, `%esi`, and `%edi`, depending on the architecture and compiler.

2. **Return Address**:
   - The address to which the control should return after the function completes execution. It is pushed onto the stack by the calling function before calling the callee.

3. **Parameters**:
   - Values passed to the function from the caller. These are pushed onto the stack in reverse order (right to left in C) before calling the function.

4. **Local Variables**:
   - Variables declared within the function. They are allocated space on the stack and accessed using offsets from the frame pointer or stack pointer.

## Detailed Description

- **Saved Registers**: Registers are saved by the callee (`main()` function in this case) to preserve their values across function calls. This ensures that the function can safely modify registers without affecting the calling function.

- **Return Address**: Indicates where the control should return after the function completes its execution. It is pushed onto the stack before any parameters are pushed.

- **Parameters**: Values passed to the function by the caller (`main()` or another function). They are pushed onto the stack in reverse order before calling the function.

- **Local Variables**: Variables declared within the function (`main()` or any other function). They are allocated space on the stack and accessed using offsets from the frame pointer or stack pointer.
